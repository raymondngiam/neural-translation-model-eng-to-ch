## Neural Translation Model (English-to-Chinese)

---

### Overview

This project is to develop a neural translation model to translate **english** sentences **into chinese** using recurrent neural networks, namely LSTM (Long Short Term Memory).

The project was adopted from Coursera course **Customising your models with TensorFlow 2**. The original project was to create a **english-to-german** translation model.

Model layout of the **english-to-chinse neural translation model** is a follows:
